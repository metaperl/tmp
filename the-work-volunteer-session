# I become very irritated when Carol smacks /slurps.

## Question 1 - Is a fact that she makes certain sounds.

It's hard to do The Work on facts. In the Work, what we are doing is The work on our thoughts about it.

... And that means (my thinking about it). I have judgements about it. 

So, now, recall a time when you got irritated and say what thoughts come up:
• barbaric
• maybe past life programming because it started at age 5 or 6 before social programming
• maybe when young I was abused and heard same sounds 

# Let's try: *Her sounds drive me crazy*

## Now, Go back to a specific time when with her, she's eating and she's making sounds Question 1 - Now, back in that situation : is that true

(me laughs) - No, I drive me crazy!

## q3 = how do you react? Tension.  Emotion : tightening up. Irritated. 
## q4 - how do you treat her / think about her
- if fly on Wall could see actions and thought of me, what would it see? 
- resentment, judgemental (gross barbaric) 
- nothing wrong with these thoughts. Just trying to get to thoughts
- how treating myself? Feel like a victim

- any images from past? 

# Uncle Thomas house, age 5, scratched face

## Realization: These sounds bother me, regardless of eating or sex if someone else enjoying I become resentful 

# Any images from future? 
- with boss, having to say nothing because sounds irritate me

## Who would you be if you didn't have those thoughts
- more relaxed
- more present

## Turn around on "the sounds drive me crazy" 
1. The sounds make me happy
2. The sounds don't drive me crazy.... You are not in a mental ward. You didn't break up with her. 
3. The sounds drive me to sanity. **BINGO**

Reality is just what it is. 

i just have my thoughts about the sound.

Finding a turnaround is Like trying on shoes in shoe store. Not trying to force for into shoes

# Try another statement about situation : she is barbaric 
Im irritated with Carol because she is barbaric (when she eats and drinks) 

Q1 response: we all are barbaric in some ways. But by we know that you mean barbaric as lower than me

No more inquiry needed

## Now : living turnaround

One that makes you feel better and moving it into your life
• Carol I don't know what it is about these sounds, but I've had an upset since 6 years old but I am struggling to stay present with you because of that... Not blaming yet authentic. I get tense. I feel I want to leave. I know this is much bigger. I just need to share this with you because I am having this reaction. 
• authentic living turnaround - thank you 

# Profusely thanked the facilitator for volunteering

She was grateful because by working with me, she grew also. She has a problem with people stuffing their mouth so much that food is falling down and she has judgemental
thoughts and our session made her more aware.

Stuffing mouth so food falls down. Guided
