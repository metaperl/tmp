# Summary report of my flagrant behavior on Sunday September 10, 2023 at Business Meeting and the email trail that followed


After morning worship and lunch, there was a decision to hold the business meeting even though some key people were absent. The first item of business was to ratify the minutes from the previous month. The Clerk said “do all agree to this summary report of last month’s minutes”? 

It was at this point that I said: 

> “I am not in agreement with the statement that COVID rates are rising in Florida. Before I could agree with such a statement, I would need to confirm at least the following:
> the existence of the Corona Virus, The infectiousness of the Corona Virus, Evidence that there is a working test for the Corona Virus

It was at this point that webinar-dude said “Oh jesus” in an exasperated tone of voice.

Then the Clerk said: “This is not the time or place to debate the reality of COVID."

To this i said: “but you called for agreement on last month’s minutes and I do not agree with a statement in those minutes. I do not wish for it to look like all of us have engaged in uncritical thinking and accepted that statement without examining it’s accuracy… by the way, webinar-dude: why did you say ‘oh jesus’ after I spoke?”

To this webinar-dude said: “Quit making trouble”.

I replied: “I’m not making trouble. I’m serious about truth and it greatly concerns me that everyone here is accepting this statement into the record without any examination or commenting that the statement is closer to belief than fact until scrutinized."

The clerk then said; “terrence, I’m going to have to ask you to leave”

I replied: “And I’m going to have to ask you to suck my dick”

The clerk said; “Ok, I’m calling 911 to have the police remove you”

I replied: “What kind of coward are you to rely on the police? Why cant you just talk to me?” As I said this, i moved directly opposite him and looked him in the eyes.

The clerk put away his phone. I sat down.

lady-at-meeting interceded and stated that there are in fact Quaker processes for assessing the accuracy of statements but this part of the business meeting was not designed to address it. I thanked lady-at-meeting for her compassionate and
understanding response to my initial concern.

The clerk stood up and spoke in a loud tone towards me. I said: “have a seat". He continued to speak loudly and move towards me. I said: “lower your voice” The clerk continued to speak even louder and move towards me, saying “I’m giving you a taste of your own medicine.” Eventually he did go sit down at which point I stood up and went on a maniacal rant about how everyone in the business meeting was a hypnotized zombie that was suffering from mind control. 

Eventually I left, calling the Clerk a coward and the last thing I said was ‘oh by the way, I thought the master power was silence” and exited the building.

 i realize that you may or may not have bigger fish to fry than what i am asking 
 about in this email. 
 But my question to you for right now is:

One week ago on Sunday at around 10:25am I went over and disconnected the audio 
from the zoom webinar because there was a lot of chatter on the Zoom call and i 
felt it was disturbing the people in the room.

Do you feel that this behavior was acceptable and do you approve of it being done 
again? If not what alternative course of action do you recommend?
```

Personally I regret not being in the room at that time to monitor the Zoom -- I 
stretch myself too thin.
I would have muted them or said something, I'm sure.
I do not like for there to be chatter and noises before Worship begins.

As for if it was appropriate for you to disconnect the audio, technically, no, 
but I understand why you did and I'm not upset about it.
As for it being done again -- I hope that situation will not repeat itself.

I'm a little surprised you even asked -- I doubted whether you would return to 
Meeting after today -- after all, why would you want to associate with a bunch of 
ignorant, arrogant losers (and all the other things you called us as you were going 
down the stairs) like us who threatened to call the cops on you???

I was going to email you to ask for you to make an appointment with me to come 
pick up your things you left on the counter.

Let me be very clear: you are not welcome to attend Meeting for Business if you 
cannot conduct yourself accordingly. 
You continue to interrupt the meeting, month after month, with one "concern" or 
another that you find not to your liking.
IT IS ONE THING TO VOICE YOUR OPINION, IT IS ANOTHER THING TO INSIST THE MEETING 
AGREE WITH YOU.

This was the second time we were forced to close meeting early because of your 
ranting about COVID.
There will not be a third.

I left a large plastic vase there that I was hoping you could fill with additional 
plant cuttings before next sunday.

The two small glass jars could also have a small cutting each in my opinion.
```

Did you not read my reply yesterday from your email asking about turning off the 
sound on Zoom? 
Now you're asking for more cuttings and implying you will attend next Sunday?

You can come during the week to pick up your book and vase and cuttings, 
just let me know what day you plan to come. I will have them in a box on the 
bench outside waiting for you.

I suggest you find some like-minded polyamorous, flat-earthers, COVID-deniers to 
hang out with.

To come and sleep for an hour in the recliner on Sundays does not a Quaker make 
you. 
You exhibit no knowledge of living the Testimonies, Quaker process, or respect 
for Meeting.
After the way you disrespected the people, the place, and the process yesterday 
with your passive-aggressive behavior, your swearing and name calling in the 
Worship Room, and your disruption of Meeting for Business, you are no longer welcome 
to attend Meeting.

You have behaved disruptively in the past, but we have given you more chances. 
Yesterday was your last straw -- the one that broke the camel's back.

Let me know when you want to pick up your things BEFORE Sunday or let me know if I 
should just discard them.

# Irrelevant emails coordinating the pickup of my personal property omitted

It was notable of the clerk how responsive he was by email, text and voice to get my property ready.

# Email from clerk Sep 13, 2023, 9:12AM

I created a Google document in which I attempted to objectively record what occurred during my meltdown
at the business meeting. I invited the clerk to edit the document for accuracy. His response:

> My mistake.

> I meant to to say "Meeting" in the first email -- not just Meeting for Business.

> Please do not press the issue.
> You outlived your welcome at our Meeting.

What the clerk is clarifying is that in `Clerk responds at 3:56pm` (above) the clerk said: "you are not welcome to attend Meeting for Business if you cannot conduct 
yourself accordingly. " and he meant to say "you are not welcome to attend Meeting if you cannot conduct 
yourself accordingly. "

What I find confusing even about the redacted sentence is the word "if" - since the Clerk said "if" and not "since" he did
not say I was banned. I.e. if he had said "you are not welcome to attend Meeting for Business SINCE you cannot conduct 
yourself accordingly. " then it would've been clear that the clerk was deep-sixing me.

What was the title of the book that you lent me? 
I presume that you were able to retrieve it from the shelf downstairs?
